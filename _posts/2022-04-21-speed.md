# Speed

Here are some lightning-fast facts about speed:

* The fastest humans run at about 10 m/s (meters per second).
* Light travels at about 300,000 km/s (kilometers per second).
* The fastest land animal, the cheetah, travels at 100 km/h (kilometers per hour).
* The fastest snail, which might've won the National Snail-Racing Compeitition, travels at 50 m/h (meters per hour).
* New York is moving away from London at 20 millimeters per year.

Speed is the distance you move divided by the time you take. (In other words, `speed = distance/time` or `s = d/t`.) That means 10 m/s means `10 meters/1 second`, pronouced as "10 meters per 1 second" or "10 meters per second".

Let's change everything into m/s.

* `10 m/s = 10 m/s` Nice and simple.
* `300,000 km/s = 300,000,000 m/s` Bit harder.
* `100 km/h = 100 kilometers/1 hour * 1 hour/60 minutes = 100 kilometers/60 minutes * 1 minute/60 seconds = 100 kilometers/3,600 seconds = 27.78 m/s`
